Ingredients
 - 1 cup soy sauce
 - 1/2 cup orange juice
 - 3 Tbsp honey
 - 1 tsp fish sauce
 - 2 garlic cloves, minced
 - 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
 - 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
 - 3 Tbsp cornstarch
 - 1 lb flank steak, thinly sliced against the grain
 - 3 crowns of broccoli, cut into florets
 - salt and pepper, to taste

Directions
 1. Whisk together soy sauce, orange juice, honey, fish sauce, garlic, ginger,
    red pepper flakes, cornstarch, and salt and pepper.

 2. Place sliced flank steak in a shallow bowl and cover with whisked mixture.
    Refrigerate for 30 mins.

 3. After meat has refrigerated, place a large pan over medium heat. Add ~1 Tbsp
    oil to the pan when hot, then add broccoli florets. Add 1 tsp of water and
    cook till bright green and soft. Remove and set aside.

 4. Heat pan over high heat, add some more oil, then add meat and sauce, trying
